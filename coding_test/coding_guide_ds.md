    üéØ WHAT TO DO:
    - Read the entire problem TWICE

      * Time/space limitations
    
    üß† QUESTIONS TO ASK:
    - What type of problem is this? (Array, string, graph, etc.)
    - What's the input size? (affects algorithm choice)
    - Are there any special constraints?
    - What are the edge cases I need to handle?
    
    üö® RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:
    - "Minimum/maximum" ‚Üí might need optimization
    - "All possible ways" ‚Üí might need recursion/DP
    - "In sorted array" ‚Üí use two pointers or binary search
    - "Unique elements" ‚Üí consider using sets

## Python Coding Fundamentals

### Essential Data Structures

```python
# Lists - most common for arrays/sequences
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.append(6)           # Add to end
arr.insert(0, 0)        # Insert at index
arr.remove(3)           # Remove first occurrence
arr.pop()               # Remove and return last
arr.index(2)            # Find index of value

# Sets - for unique elements and fast lookups
unique_nums = set([1, 2, 2, 3])  # {1, 2, 3}
unique_nums.add(4)
unique_nums.discard(1)   # Remove if exists
1 in unique_nums         # O(1) lookup

# Dictionaries - for frequency counting and mappings
freq = {}
for num in [1, 2, 2, 3]:
    freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
# or use collections.Counter
from collections import Counter
freq = Counter([1, 2, 2, 3])  # {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1}
```

### List Comprehensions & Functional Programming

```python
# List comprehensions - more Pythonic than loops
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
evens = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
matrix = [[i+j for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]

# Map, filter, reduce
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))

from functools import reduce
product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, nums)  # 120
```

### String Manipulation

```python
text = "Hello World Data Science"

# Common operations
text.lower()                    # lowercase
text.split()                    # split on whitespace
text.split('o')                 # split on character
text.replace('World', 'Python') # replace substring
text.startswith('Hello')        # boolean check
text.endswith('Science')        # boolean check

# Join lists into strings
words = ['Data', 'Science', 'Rocks']
sentence = ' '.join(words)      # "Data Science Rocks"
```

## Algorithm & Data Structure Patterns

### üîç Understanding MEX Problems (Like Your Example)

**What is MEX?** Think of MEX as "What's the smallest number I can't make?" 
- Given numbers [1, 3, 10], I can't make 0, so MEX = 0
- Given numbers [0, 1, 2, 8], I can make 0, 1, 2 but not 3, so MEX = 3
- It's always the first "gap" in the sequence starting from 0

**How to Solve MEX Problems:**

```python
def find_mex_explained(arr):
    """
    Step-by-step MEX finder with Feynman explanation
    
    Think: "I'm looking for the first number that's missing 
    when I count up from 0"
    """
    # Step 1: Put all numbers in a set for instant lookup
    # Why set? Because checking "is 5 in my_set" is super fast O(1)
    available_numbers = set(arr)
    
    # Step 2: Count up from 0 until we find a gap
    # Like counting seats in a theater - first empty seat is our answer
    candidate = 0
    while candidate in available_numbers:
        candidate += 1
    
    return candidate

# MEX Update Problem - "How do I change the MEX with minimum removals?"
def solve_mex_update_step_by_step(arr):
    """
    Strategy: To change MEX, I need to either:
    1. Remove a number that's currently filling a gap, OR
    2. Add the current MEX number (but we can only remove)
    
    Think: If MEX=3, numbers 0,1,2 must be present. 
    Remove any of 0,1,2 and MEX becomes smaller.
    """
    current_mex = find_mex_explained(arr)
    
    # Edge case: if MEX is already 0, we can't make it smaller
    if current_mex == 0:
        return -1
    
    # Find the smallest number that's currently "plugging a hole"
    # These are numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., MEX-1
    for num in range(current_mex):
        if num in arr:
            return 1  # Remove one occurrence of this number
    
    return -1  # Shouldn't reach here logically

# üéØ MEX Problem-Solving Tips:
# 1. Always think "what's the first gap?"
# 2. Use sets for O(1) lookup when checking presence
# 3. For update problems, focus on numbers 0 to MEX-1
# 4. Edge case: MEX=0 means remove any number to make MEX smaller
```

### Pattern 1: Two Pointers - "The Squeeze Technique"
**Think of it like:** Two people walking towards each other in a line

```python
def two_pointers_explained(arr, target):
    """
    Imagine: You're at both ends of a sorted bookshelf, 
    walking towards the middle looking for two books

    left = 0              # Person starting from left end
    right = len(arr) - 1  # Person starting from right end
    
    while left < right:   # Until they meet
        current_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
        
        if current_sum == target:

## Time Management & Strategy

### 30-Minute Coding Challenge Strategy

**Minutes 1-3: Understanding**
- Read problem twice carefully
- Identify input/output format
- Note constraints (array size, value ranges)
- Classify problem type (array manipulation, string processing, etc.)

**Minutes 4-8: Planning**
- Write pseudocode or outline approach
- Consider edge cases
- Choose appropriate data structures
- Estimate time complexity

**Minutes 9-23: Implementation**
- Start with basic solution (even if not optimal)
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test with simple examples as you go

**Minutes 24-27: Testing & Edge Cases**
- Test with provided examples
- Test edge cases: empty arrays, single elements, all same values
- Check off-by-one errors

**Minutes 28-30: Final Review**
- Clean up code
- Ensure proper return statements
- Double-check variable names and logic

### Quick Reference Checklist

**Python Essentials:**
- [ ] List/dict/set operations
- [ ] String slicing and methods  
- [ ] List comprehensions
- [ ] Basic loops and conditionals
- [ ] Function definitions

**Statistics Quick Facts:**
- [ ] Probability sums to 1
- [ ] Bayes' theorem formula
- [ ] Mean vs median relationships
- [ ] Normal distribution properties
- [ ] Conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A‚à©B)/P(B)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- [ ] Off-by-one errors in arrays
- [ ] Integer vs float division
- [ ] Modifying list while iterating
- [ ] Forgetting edge cases (empty input, single element)
- [ ] Misunderstanding conditional probability direction

### Practice Problems

1. **Array Manipulation**: Implement find_mex() and update_mex() functions
2. **String Processing**: Parse product IDs and create summary statistics  
3. **Probability**: Solve 3 Bayes' theorem problems
4. **Data Analysis**: Load a CSV, parse IDs, and create geographic summaries

**Final Tips:**
- Practice writing code by hand (no autocomplete)
- Time yourself on similar problems
- Review pandas documentation for data manipulation
- Memorize probability formulas
- Always test your code with simple examples

Good luck with your exam!
